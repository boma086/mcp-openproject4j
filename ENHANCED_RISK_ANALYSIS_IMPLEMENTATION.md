**Requirements Addressed**: FR4 (Risk Analysis Tool), NFR2 (Security)  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## 🚀 Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Sophisticated Risk Scoring Algorithm
- **Multi-factor scoring**: Combines overdue severity, priority weighting, assignee workload, and project size normalization
- **Risk concentration analysis**: Evaluates percentage of tasks at risk for better project context
- **Individual task scoring**: Each task receives a risk score based on days overdue, priority, and complexity
- **Dynamic risk levels**: Uses both score-based and count-based logic for robust assessment

### 2. Advanced Security Measures (NFR2)
- **Input validation and sanitization**: Comprehensive validation of project IDs and work package data
- **API permission validation**: Checks API key configuration and accessibility before processing
- **Secure logging**: Security-aware logging that doesn't expose sensitive information
- **Data cleaning**: Prevents injection attacks and malicious content processing
- **HTTPS enforcement**: Validates secure communication protocols
- **Authentication security**: Ensures credentials are not exposed in logs or responses

### 3. Enhanced Risk Analysis Features
- **Risk trend analysis**: Evaluates whether project risks are improving, stable, or worsening
- **Near-due task detection**: Identifies tasks within 7 days of due date for proactive management
- **Severity weighting**: Critical tasks (>30 days overdue) receive higher risk multipliers
- **Assignee workload analysis**: Considers individual workload when calculating risk impact
- **Priority-based scoring**: High-priority tasks receive elevated risk scores

### 4. Comprehensive Recommendation Engine
- **Risk-level specific recommendations**: Tailored actions for low, medium, and high risk levels
- **Score-based guidance**: Recommendations based on sophisticated risk scoring thresholds
- **Task-specific advice**: Individual recommendations for each at-risk task
- **Trend-based suggestions**: Strategic advice based on risk trajectory analysis
- **Strategic recommendations**: Long-term risk management strategies and best practices

### 5. Enhanced Reporting and Visualization
- **Detailed risk audit**: Security audit trail showing all security measures applied
- **Risk score visualization**: Clear presentation of risk metrics and trends
- **Task-level breakdown**: Granular view of individual risk items with specific recommendations
- **Multi-language support**: Enhanced bilingual reporting (Chinese/English)
- **Professional formatting**: Clear, executive-ready report structure

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Core Components Added:

1. **EnhancedRiskAnalysis Record**: Comprehensive data structure holding all risk analysis results

4. **Security Validation Methods**: Input sanitization, permission checking, and secure logging
5. **Sophisticated Scoring Algorithm**: Multi-factor risk calculation with normalization

### Key Methods Implemented:

- **`analyzeRisks()`**: Enhanced main method with security validation and sophisticated scoring
- **`calculateSophisticatedRiskScore()`**: Multi-factor risk scoring algorithm
- **`validateProjectIdWithSecurity()`**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **`generateSecurityAuditReport()`**: Security compliance reporting

- **API Security**: Permission validation, secure credential handling, HTTPS enforcement
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data masking, secure logging practices
- **Error Handling**: Security-specific error reporting without information leakage

## 📊 Risk Scoring Algorithm

The enhanced algorithm considers:

1. **Base Scoring**: 10 points for overdue tasks, 3 points for near-due tasks
2. **Severity Multipliers**: 
   - >30 days overdue: 2.0x multiplier
   - 14-30 days overdue: 1.5x multiplier  
   - 7-14 days overdue: 1.2x multiplier
3. **Priority Weighting**: High priority = 1.5x, Low priority = 0.8x
4. **Workload Analysis**: >3 overdue tasks per assignee = 1.3x multiplier
5. **Project Normalization**: Score adjusted based on overall project size
6. **Risk Concentration**: >25% of tasks at risk = 1.2x penalty

## 🛡️ Security Compliance (NFR2)

The implementation addresses all NFR2 requirements:

- ✅ **Secure API Key Storage**: Uses environment variables, encrypted storage
- ✅ **HTTPS Communication**: Validates and enforces secure connections
- ✅ **Authentication Security**: No credential exposure in logs or responses
- ✅ **API Permission Validation**: Comprehensive permission checking before use
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Sanitizes all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- ✅ **Output Sanitization**: Cleanses all outputs to prevent data leakage
- ✅ **Secure Logging**: Security-aware logging without sensitive information

## 🎯 FR4 Requirements Compliance

**Risk Analysis Tool requirements fully satisfied**:

- ✅ **Overdue Task Detection**: Queries for overdue tasks (due date < today, status != closed)
- ✅ **Risk Score Calculation**: Sophisticated scoring based on number and severity of overdue tasks
- ✅ **Risk Level Categorization**: Low (<3 overdue), Medium (3-5), High (>5) with score-based refinement
- ✅ **Actionable Recommendations**: Context-specific recommendations for each risk level
- ✅ **Priority Actions**: Urgent, high-priority, and strategic recommendations
